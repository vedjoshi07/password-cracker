```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### GUI Configuration
All settings can be configured through the GUI interface:

- **Success Image**: Select the image that appears when password is correct
- **Password Length**: Number of digits in password (1-10)
- **Start From**: Starting password number (useful for resuming)
- **Max Attempts**: Maximum number of passwords to try
- **Delay**: Time between attempts (seconds)
- **Demo Mode**: Safe testing mode that simulates cracking

### CLI Configuration
Edit the configuration variables in `password_cracker.py`:

```python
SUCCESS_IMAGE = "success.png"      # Path to success detection image
PASSWORD_LENGTH = 4                # Length of password to try
START_FROM = 0                     # Starting password number
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 10000              # Maximum attempts
ATTEMPT_DELAY = 0.5               # Delay between attempts
DEMO_MODE = False                 # Set to True for safe testing
```

## üñºÔ∏è Success Image Setup

The tool requires a "success image" to detect when the correct password is entered.

### Creating a Success Image

1. **Use the built-in generator**:
   - Click "üñºÔ∏è Create Test Image" in the GUI, or
   - Run: `python create_test_image.py`

2. **Take your own screenshot**:
   - Enter a wrong password to see the "failed" state
   - Enter the correct password
   - Take a screenshot of the success message/indicator
   - Save as PNG format
   - Select the image in the GUI or place it as `success.png`

### Image Requirements
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or other common image formats
- **Content**: Should contain unique elements that only appear on success
- **Size**: Any size (tool will handle scaling)
- **Quality**: Clear, high-contrast images work best

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Demo Mode
Perfect for learning and testing:
- Set "Demo Mode" checkbox in GUI or `DEMO_MODE = True` in CLI
- Tool simulates password cracking without actually typing
- Will "find" password "1234" or "0000" for demonstration
- Safe to run anywhere

### Resuming Interrupted Sessions
If cracking is interrupted, you can resume:
1. Note the last attempted password from the log
2. Set "Start From" to that number
3. Restart the process

### Batch Processing
For testing multiple systems:
1. Create different success images for each system
2. Use CLI version with different configuration files
3. Script the process using shell scripts or batch files

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Built-in Protections
- **Failsafe**: Move mouse to top-left corner to instantly stop
- **Configurable Delays**: Prevent overwhelming target systems  
- **Demo Mode**: Safe testing without actual input
- **Stop Button**: Immediate termination in GUI
- **Keyboard Interrupt**: Ctrl+C support in CLI

### Best Practices
- Always test in Demo Mode first
- Use reasonable delays (0.5+ seconds recommended)
- Test with your own systems only
- Keep success images private and secure
- Monitor system resources during operation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"pyautogui not found"**
```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

**"PIL/Pillow not found"**
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

**GUI won't start**
- Check if tkinter is installed: `python -c "import tkinter"`
- On Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- Use CLI version as fallback: `python app.py --cli`

**Success image not detected**
- Verify image file exists and is readable
- Try recreating the success image
- Ensure success condition is visible on screen
- Test with different confidence levels

**Permission errors (macOS/Linux)**
- Grant screen recording permissions in System Preferences
- Run with appropriate permissions for automation

### Getting Help

1. **Check dependencies**: `python app.py --check`
2. **View application info**: `python app.py --info`  
3. **Test with Demo Mode** to verify basic functionality
4. **Check log output** for detailed error messages
